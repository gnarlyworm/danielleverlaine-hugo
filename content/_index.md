Danielle Verlaine is a dark romance author based in Europe. Born in London, grew up in SEA, now back in Europe blblabla.

Her debut book *Crown of Vengeance* is dark mafia romance, the first in the **Throne of Underworld** series.

When she's not spending her time writing, you can find her sprawled out crocheting, trying to Procreate (emotionally), or crying into Canva.
